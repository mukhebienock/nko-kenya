    <h1>MY CAMPUS</h1>
    <p>Was my first place in the Kenya's capital city. All the way from Bungoma south, I came with an open mind
        to explore this great city and now.............. @moringaschool.</p>

    <p>@kenyascience (teaching) --and-- @moringa (coding) how???????????
       passion, I would say but really??!!!? no! yes! no!! maybe chasing my dream till I live it.</p>

       <h2>Journey to campus</h2>
      <p>About 10hrs seated in a bus was the greatest punishment ever, perhaps, a little hell for me.
         Passing through a series of towns, I remember hearing the mention of two;
              <ul>
                <li>Eldoret</li>
                <li>Nakuru</li>
              </ul>
      </p>
